* [x] How to create and nest components
  * react components are
    * React apps building blocks
    * a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance
    * JavaScript functions that return markup
    * able to be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page
  * components:
    * [x] make: function MyButton()
    * [x] make: function MyApp() and nest MyButton into it

  * JSX
    * the markup syntax for MyButton and MyApp is called JSX
    * JSX is stricter than HTML
      * You have to close tags like `<br />`
      * Your component also canâ€™t return multiple JSX tags
      * You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a `<div>...</div>` or an empty `<>...</>` wrapper
    * If you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an online converter
